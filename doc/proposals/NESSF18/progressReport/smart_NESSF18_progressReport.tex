	\section{Introduction}
	
		The goal outlined in my NESSF17 proposal was to classify \EEs\ \citep{Brueckner1983} in the solar \TR\ according to their 2D spatial structure.
		I proposed to accomplish this goal using two sounding rocket-borne instruments optimized to observe \EEs; the \MOSES \citep{kankel1}, and the \ESIS.
		\MOSES\ flew successfully in 2006 \citep{fox1} and 2015 \citep{smart1}, and both instruments are scheduled to fly in 2019.
		\MOSES\ and \ESIS\ are members of a class of spectrograph known as a snapshot imaging spectrograph, which is designed to spectrally-resolve a 2D \FOV\ in a single snapshot. This is in contrast with another class known as an imaging spectrograph (such as \IRIS\ \citep{DePontieu2014}) which can only spectrally-resolve a 2D \FOV\ through rastering.  
		Since \EEs\ evolve faster than the rastering timescale of \IRIS \citep{kankel1,DePontieu2014}, a snapshot imaging spectrograph is necessary for adequate characterization of the spatial structure of \EEs.
		
		\MOSES\ and \ESIS\ are further classified as a specific type of snapshot imaging spectograph known as a \CTIS \citep{Okamoto:91}, which takes a snapshot of a 2D \FOV\ by simply removing the slit used in imaging spectrographs.
		However, without the slit space and spectrum become convoluted, which then requires images to be taken at several diffraction orders/angles in order to provide sufficient information about the scene.
		Applying \CT\ inversion algorithms to these images yields a spectrally-resolved 2D scene, hence the name \CTIS.
		As stated in the NESSF17 proposal, \MOSES\ and \ESIS\ image in a limited number of diffraction orders/angles (only 3 to 6), making the process of spectrally-resolving their data is an ill-posed inversion problem \citep{kankel1}.
		
		A brute-force approach to addressing this ill-posed inversion problem would be to use a forward model of \MOSES/\ESIS\ and an a priori model of solar \TR\ spectra as a means to create a dictionary of spectral structures and their corresponding signatures on the \CTIS\ detectors.
		This would allow \CTIS\ observations to be matched to entries in this dictionary in order to recover a spectrally-resolved scene.
		I developed an approximation to the above brute-force approach using \NNs, known as a \CINN.
		This approximation aims to spectrally-resolve \MOSES\ and \ESIS\ observations using thousands of \IRIS\ \SiIV\ spectra as a model of the solar \TR.
		
		\NNs\ are an efficient regression technique for fitting a curve to an arbitrary set of data \citep{ai}, known as the training data.
		Our \CINNs\ are \NNs\ designed to invert a function that maps spectral line parameters to their corresponding signal on the \CTIS\ detectors.
		To accomplish this, we apply a \CTIS\ forward model to a large set of \IRIS\ \SiIV\ spectra and then use a \NN\ to fit the inverse function.
		The \CTIS\ forward model is spatially invariant, so it is not necessary to make a \NN\ large enough to invert an entire \CTIS\ image.
		Instead, we may implement a \NN\ that can invert a single pixel and then convolve this \NN\ with a \CTIS\ observation to construct a spectrally-resolved image.
		This type of neural network is known as a \CNN\ and is an important optimization that makes this problem tractable on a modern consumer \GPU.
			
		We have completed a simple realization of a \CINN\ for the \MOSES-06 instrument (the \DIN) which reconstructs the Doppler-shift of the \HeII\ spectral line observed by \MOSES-06.
		We found that our implementation of a \DIN\ was more accurate at reconstructing large Doppler velocities than existing \CT\ algorithms are capable of.
		However, we also discovered that \CRS\ in the \IRIS\ \SiIV\ observations were confounding the predictive power of our \DIN, motivating the addition of a \IRIS\ despiking routine into our procedure.
		Existing \IRIS\ despiking routines were ill-suited to processing thousands of \IRIS\ observations because of the need to manually tune these routines for each unique \IRIS\ observation.
		Therefore, we developed our own GPU-accelerated despiking routine designed to provide acceptable automated despiking performance across our \IRIS\ dataset.
		
		For the remainder of my NESSF17 proposal (up to 09-01-18), I plan to introduce numerous improvements to our \IRIS\ data pipeline, including the improved despiking routine. I also plan to produce a publication describing the application of our \DIN\ to the \MOSES-06 dataset.
		In my proposed schedule for NESSF18, I will develop and produce a publication on an improved \CINN\ with the capability to reconstruct the full spectral line profile of the \MOSES-06 observation (dubbed a \SPIN), and begin development of an \EE\ classification scheme.		
	
	\section{NESSF17 Progress Report} 
	
		We presented preliminary results of a \SPIN\ for inverting the \MOSES-06 dataset in Section 2.3 of our NESSF17 proposal.
		An important issue with these results is that they are blurry with respect to the original image.
		It was expected that we could resolve this issue by creating a larger \NN\, but it persisted regardless of the network size.
		After more research it was determined that this behavior was due our use of the Euclidean norm as a loss function, the function that measures the fit of the \NN\ to the data.
		This is a well-documented limitation of using the Euclidean norm for image reconstruction \citep{Pathak2016}.
		It was determined that we would require a more sophisticated loss function, which we will discuss further in Section \ref{sec_gan}, but first we decided to try to solve a simpler problem using our existing architecture.
					
		\subsection{Doppler Inversion Network}
		
			\EEs\ are characterized by non-thermal Doppler broadening on the order of 100\,km/s and/or comparable Doppler shifts of an \TR\ emission line \citep{Dere1989}.
			Therefore, to identify and classify \EEs\ we do not necessarily need to recover the spectral line profile from a \CTIS\ instrument, just the Doppler shift and width of the line profile.
			Solving for these two parameters is simpler than solving for the spectral line profile since they contain less information.
			We modified our \SPIN, which mapped \MOSES\ observations to spectral line profiles, into a \DIN\ that mapped \MOSES\ observations to the \textit{mean} of a spectral line profile, a measurement of Doppler shift.
			The \DIN\ allows for the extraction of useful plasma parameters while retaining the simplicity of our original method.
			
			Our \DIN\ implementation is a \CNN\ with a $21\times 1$ pixel kernel that is convolved with MOSES observations to calculate the Doppler shift at each pixel.
			Our training dataset consisted of 4.5k \IRIS\ spectra selected for their high \SNR. We also constructed a validation dataset containing the same number of images in order to test our method against a statistical independent sample.
			This kernel size represents a window of $\pm$300\,km/s in MOSES pixels, providing a healthy margin around the typical 100\,km/s size of \EEs \citep{Dere1994}.
			For this kernel size, we developed two networks: a \textit{Test} network with 1k free parameters, and a \textit{Final} network with 800k free parameters.
			In Table \ref{nn_table} we have listed some important properties of these two networks, along with some qualitative measures of their performance.
			This was done as a preliminary test of the quality of the reconstructed results, as a function of network complexity.
			We can see that both networks were able to achieve an RMS velocity error better than the theoretical resolution of MOSES (29\,km/s).
			We also note that the training time was very short, only 15 minutes for the Final network.
			This performance is possible thanks to \GPU\ implementations of our \NN\ libraries.

				\label{dopp_ex}
			\end{figure*}
			
			In Figure \ref{dopp_ex} we have provided a few validation examples of our method, where we have plotted the reconstructed Doppler velocity along with the true velocity for comparison. 
			We chose to show these validation examples since they demonstrated reasonably-high Doppler velocities, characteristic of some types of \EEs.
			We can see that in areas of high signal the network does reasonably well at reproducing the true Doppler shift, while in areas of low signal the Doppler shift is underestimated.
			We anticipate that the despiking procedure outlined in Section \ref{sec_dspk} will improve results in these low-signal areas, since spikes are more effective at changing the estimated Doppler shift in these areas.

				\label{dopp_hist}
			\end{figure*}

			Currently, the \SMART\citep{fox1} serves as the de facto standard algorithm for MOSES spectral line profile inversions.
			In Figure \ref{smart_hist} we can see an important test of this algorithm; the reconstructed Doppler velocity (mean) of the reconstructed spectral line profile compared to the mean of the original (or true) line profile.
			This test can be represented as a scatterplot since it consisted of applying \SMART\ to a single SUMER raster.
			
			In Figure \ref{din_hist} we present an analogue of Figure \ref{smart_hist} for the \DIN\ calculated using our validation dataset.
			Since the validation dataset is so large, it would be poorly represented as a scatterplot, so we present it as a column-normalized 2D histogram, where each bin of the histogram has been divided by the sum of its column.
			This presentation demonstrates the probability of accurately reconstructing the Doppler velocity as a function of the true Doppler velocity.
			We have also plotted the line of perfect reconstruction; if the algorithm were perfect, all the probability would be in pixels under this line.
			We calculated Pearson's $r$ of this histogram for both our Test and Final networks, and were able to verify that the additional free parameters corresponded to significant improvement in the performance of the network under this metric.
			
			\SMART\ has a systematic tendency to underestimate the reconstructed velocity which is a well studied property of this algorithm \citep{Fox2011,Rust2017}.
			We can see that the \DIN\ does a much better job, on average, of correctly estimating the velocity, however there is still significant underestimation of velocity.
			We speculate that this underestimation is at least partially due to \CRSs\ in both the training and validation datasets, which we will discuss in Section \ref{sec_dspk}.
			For now, we consider these results exciting verification of our method since the \DIN\ method allows for more accurate reconstructions of high-velocity events such as \EEs.

			Spikes in IRIS observations are a stochastic process, primarily due to ionospheric particles impacting the CCD detectors \citep{itn15}.
			Removal of spikes in our training dataset is important since the network will become distracted trying to reconstruct the spikes, a futile undertaking.
			This was not considered to be a serious problem during the proposal phase, as there have been several despiking routines written for IRIS.
			However we failed to appreciate how difficult it would be to apply these routines in an automated fashion to a large section of the IRIS \SiIV\ dataset.
			
			There are a multitude of despiking routines available on the IDL SolarSoft libraries, such as \texttt{nospike.pro}, \texttt{array\_despike.pro}, \texttt{iris\_prep\_despike.pro}.
			All these procedures identify spikes using the same method: convolution of some kernel with an image to estimate a local mean and standard deviation, and a hard threshold to exclude pixels some number of standard deviations above the mean.
			This method is often too aggressive in areas of high signal intensity and not aggressive enough in areas of low signal intensity.
			In Figure \ref{dspk_ex}, we see an example of this behavior: the explosive event in the bottom row has become eroded from \texttt{iris\_prep\_despike.pro}, while many of the spikes in the top row are only partially identified.
			Considering this behavior, in order to use these procedures we found that we would have to manually tune them for each observation, which would become prohibitive for a training dataset composed of many IRIS observations.
			
			Instead of estimating the mean and standard deviation, our method uses a median-percentile based approach, where pixels are marked as spikes if their value is larger than 99\% (for example) of all other pixels with the same median. 
			This is accomplished by calculating a local median for every pixel in the observation, and then constructing a histogram of local median vs. pixel value for each observation.
			From this histogram, we can then determine the bad pixel threshold as a function of the local median.
			Finally, this procedure was performed independently along each axis (wavelength, space, time) and we required that a pixel must be above the threshold for all three axes to be marked as a spike.
			A visualization of this procedure is presented in Figure \ref{dspk_hist}, where we can see the thresholds of each axis overplotted on the histograms used to perform the despiking seen in Figure \ref{dspk_ex}.		
			We have developed a GPU implementation of this despiking procedure, resulting in code that is at least 10x faster than current implementations while being much more discriminatory at avoiding false positives and false negatives.

		
	\section{Remainder of NESSF17 Schedule}
	
		With the exception of exchanging the \SPIN\ development for the \DIN\ development, we are consistent with the schedule given in my NESSF17 proposal, on track for a publication to be submitted before the end date of the proposal period.
		This publication will cover the motivation, implementation, and validation of our \DIN, with applications to the \MOSES-06 dataset.
		We will compare the inversions recovered using the \DIN\ to those calculated using other methods to determine if the \DIN\ is a worthwhile improvement.
		Our inversions of the \MOSES-06 dataset will be available to the public, to support further investigations into this dataset.
		Also, we will release our despiking routine to the public to promote easier analysis of \IRIS\ data and allow other researchers to adapt the code for their needs.
		
		Before the results of our method can be published, we need to make a few improvements to the training data pipeline, such as: the despiking procedure discussed in Section \ref{sec_dspk}; a model of the \MOSES-06 passband \citep{Fox2011}; a solar continuum model around \HeII \citep{Fox2011}; and an accurate noise model for the \MOSES-06 detectors \cite{Rust2017}.
		We also need to implement some critical preprocessing steps to the \MOSES-06 dataset such as: \PSF\ deconvolution \citep{Rust2017} and spectral contamination removal \citep{Parker2016}.
		Additionally, we need to improve our network architecture to include the width of the spectral line profile.
		Finally, our validation tests need to be improved, with \SMART\ applied to the same validation set as the \DIN, and several simple validation tests such as those in \cite{Rust2017}.
	
	\section{NESSF18 Proposal}
	
		We are proposing to continue this research under the NESSF18 solicitation.
		The results we have obtained so far show that our method is superior to current techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy of Doppler shift.
		We think this merits additional investigation into using \CNN\ techniques to interpret data from \CTIS\ instruments such as \MOSES\ and \ESIS.
		Furthermore, we have made progress in terms of our \CTIS\ analysis tools, but haven't yet developed any software to address our ultimate goal of classifying \EEs.
		We plan to implement a more sophisticated \SPIN\ during the first half of the NESSF18 proposal period, and to begin work on an \EE\ classifier during the second half of the proposal period.
	
		\subsection{MOSES Inversion GAN} \label{sec_gan}
		
			An exciting advancement in using \CNNs\ for image reconstruction has been the development of \textit{adversial loss}, as opposed to the Euclidean loss currently used by our networks. 
			This concept is expressed in a new type of \NN\ called a \GAN, developed by \cite{Goodfellow2014}. 
			In this type of network, our current \DIN\ is known as the \textit{generator} network, and its output is an input to the \textit{adversary} network. 
			The adversary network's task is to compare the output image of the generator network to the true image and determine which one was created by the generator network.
			The loss is minimized when the adversary network can't distinguish between the generated image and the true image \citep{Isola2016}.
			This method was recently used for \PSF\ deconvolution of astrophysical images by \cite{Schawinski2017}, the results of which indicate that this is a powerful technique that is well-suited to our inversion problem.
			
			Our plan is to pursue development of a \GAN\ for a \MOSES\ \SPIN\ after submitting our publication describing the \DIN.
			We expect the development time should be relatively short considering that we can use the training dataset from the \DIN.
			If this \MOSES\ inversion \GAN\ shows improvement over our current method, we will publish a short article describing the implementation and results of our approach.
			
		
		\subsection{Explosive Event Classification}
		
			The literature has conducted extensive analyses of \EEs\ using rastering imaging spectrographs, such as \IRIS.
			They identify \EEs\ as an enhancement of the red and/or blue wings of emission lines forming between 20,000\,K and 250,000\,K \citep{Moses1994}.
			These events are often spectrally classified into two groups: those with enhancements in both wings and those with enhancement in only one wing \citep{Dere1989}.
			The wings are sometimes displaced from one another by a few thousand kilometers \citep{Dere1994}, indicating a dynamic spatial structure.
			Recently, \cite{Innes2015} interpreted \EEs\ as evidence of  MHD reconnection through the plasmoid instability, however there have been many other explanations for \EEs, including flows along loops \citep{Teriaca2004}, flows along spicules \citep{Wilhelm2000}, and plasma ejection and retraction \citep{Huang2014}.
			Presently, it is unclear if \EEs\ may be explained by only one physical mechanism, or if multiple mechanisms are necessary to describe their characteristics.
			
			In our NESSF17 proposal we asked: \textbf{If these events do arise from multiple mechanisms, can we distinguish different types of explosive events by considering their spatial structure?}
			To answer this question, the spectrally-resolved images of the solar \TR\ taken using \MOSES, and later \ESIS, will be used to isolate \EEs\ and construct a database of events.
			Then, to test if \EEs\ may naturally be classified into different groups, we will apply simple \textit{clustering} algorithms, such as $k$-means \citep{Macqueen1967}.
			This is an important first step to see if any obvious classes of \EEs\ may be identified.
			We intend to present preliminary results of our investigation into this method in our NESSF19 progress report.
